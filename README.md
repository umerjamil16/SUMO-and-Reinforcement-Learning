# SUMO and Reinforcement Learning

Simulation of Urban MObility is an open source, portable, microscopic and continuous multi-modal traffic simulation package designed to handle large networks. (https://sumo.dlr.de/docs/index.html)


This repo contains my main work while developing Single Agent and Multi Agent Reinforcement Learning Traffic Light Controller Agent in SUMO environment. 

Further details is as follows:

- Project 1:
	- Implementation of non-RL MaxPressure Agent in SUMO. Work focused on using queue lenght and vehicle waiting time to control a Traffic Light Controller (TLC)       
- Project 2:
	- Generating dynamic graph of traffic road netowork in SUMO 
- Project 3 
	- Implementation of Max Pressure Agent using OOP   
- Project 4 
	- Implementation of a naive deep Q network in SUMO 
- Project 5 
	- Implementation of a Deep Q Network in SUMO ([ref paper link](https://web.stanford.edu/class/psych209/Readings/MnihEtAlHassibis15NatureControlDeepRL.pdf))
- Project 6 
	- Implementation of a Double Deep Q Network in SUMO  ([ref paper link](https://arxiv.org/abs/1509.06461))      

## Future Work Direction
- Traffic generation plan
- State space representation 
- MARL
